# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8
x1=3
x2=5
print (x1 + x2)
# Write a print statement that uses the division operator / 
print(20/8)
# Add a print statement that uses multiplication *
print(6*8)
# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
length=5
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it
width=4
# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`
area=length*width
# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable
print(f"the result is{area}")

# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables. 
print(f'if the length of a rectangle is {length}and width is {width}then the area is{area}')
